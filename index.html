<h4><strong>About panner butter masala</strong></h4>
<p><em>Paneer Butter Masala Recipe | Butter Paneer Recipe | Cheese Butter Masala</em> with detailed photo and video recipe. Perhaps one of the premium north Indian or Punjabi curries if not the king of the paneer curries. It is known for its mildly sweet and spicy taste with the goodness of fresh cream and butter topping with moist paneer. It is one of the most curries for most vegetarians and is prepared for lunch and dinner and served with freshly baked roti, chapati, naan and even a choice of rice.</p>
<p>It can be added to rice, bread, pizza, sandwich and even deep-fried snacks, but curries are the popular choice. Out of these paneer curries, the paneer butter masala recipe or also known as paneer makhani is a popular choice for its sweet and spicy curry taste. We always assume that most North Indian or Punjabi curries use the same gravy base with the same technique and hence it must be easy to prepare. This has been one of the stereotypes, especially for paneer-based recipes or curries. Perhaps even during my initial days of culinary learning, <strong>I use</strong> to make all the paneer curries but name them differently as per the occasion. But trust me, there are so many subtle variations and nuances that go into each and every Punjabi curry which makes it unique and hence the unique names. For instance, in this recipe of butter paneer, the base is prepared with onion and tomato but is handled differently compared to matar paneer or Kadai . In addition, there is a generous amount of butter and fresh cream used which makes it a mild sweet and spicy curry. Moreover, the spice addition is minimal and hence it is appreciated all over the world and not just in India.</p>
